Get orangefs from https://github.com/waltligon/orangefs

use "prepare" to create a config file

Use "configure" to create a make file

Use "make dist" to create a tar file with orangefs source and documentation:
pvfs-2.10.0-orangefs-DEVEL-2024-09-10-202757.tar.gz

Adjust tar file name to comply with debian naming convention:
mv pvfs-2.10.0-orangefs-DEVEL-2024-09-10-202757.tar.gz orangefs_2.10.0.orig.tar.gz

Debian control files:
debian/copyright
debian/changelog
debian/source/format
debian/rules
debian/control

git clean -dqfs         <-------- think before typing
cp ../orangefs/pvfs-2.10.0-orangefs-DEVEL-2025-04-07-183512.tar.gz orangefs_2.10.0.orig.tar.gz


debuild builds a debian package:
tar xf orangefs_2.10.0.orig.tar.gz
cd *57
cp -r ../debian .
debuild -us -uc

Goal: use "apt install" on prepared orangefs package.

----------------[ lintan: initial-upload-closes-no-bugs ]------------------

use "reportbug" to file an itp.

google "file a debian itp with reportbug" to get some instructions.

What It Means: The warning is triggered when a package’s debian/changelog
file for its first upload (version 1.0 or similar) does not include a
Closes: #bug-number statement to indicate that it resolves a specific
Debian bug, such as an Intent to Package (ITP) bug. In Debian, new
packages are typically introduced to address an ITP bug filed in the
Debian Bug Tracking System (BTS), which documents the intent to package
a new piece of software (e.g., OrangeFS).

Since OrangeFS is a new package you’re Debianizing, you should have filed
an Intent to Package (ITP) bug in the Debian BTS before uploading. The ITP
bug serves as a public record of your intent to package OrangeFS and
allows other maintainers to provide feedback or avoid duplicate work.
